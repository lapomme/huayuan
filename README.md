# 樺源黑體 Huayuan Gothic

樺源黑體是一套基於昭源黑體、思源黑體改造，融合手寫韻味的開源字型。部分字形取自台北黑體。目前支援香港、台灣常用字，共有兩個字重，未來提供Light字重。

Huayuan Gothic is a font derived from Chiron Sans HK and Source Han Sans, and integrates handwritten and print features in its design. Some characters are taken from Taipei TC Sans. Currently common characters for Hong Kong and Taiwan are supported, and there are two weights, Regular and Bold. Light will be released in the future.
